        <h1>Learning Journey</h1>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Why I Like C++, Python, and JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
           I used to enjoy game development, but when I came to university, they started teaching C++. That’s how I got into it. Learning C++ at university was interesting because we did a lot of practical work, and it turned out to be fun.

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Why I'm Learning Ruby</h2>
          <p>
            I had the choice to learn either Node.js or Ruby, and after reading about both, I found Ruby to be unique and fun. Its elegant syntax and developer-friendly nature made it stand out to me. Ruby on Rails, in particular, is a powerful framework that simplifies web development, making it easier to create robust and scalable applications. This aligns perfectly with my passion for web development and my goal to build efficient and user-friendly solutions.

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Learning Methods</h2>
          <p>
            My primary learning resource is The Odin Project, which provides a structured approach to mastering web development. I also reinforce my knowledge by building projects and solving real-world problems.

          <h2>US Exchange Program</h2>
          <p>
            I had the incredible opportunity to spend a year in the USA, and it was truly an amazing experience. Immersing myself in their culture gave me a deeper understanding of their way of life, values, and traditions. Beyond that, I had the chance to meet people from all around the world, which broadened my perspective in ways I hadn’t imagined. Engaging with individuals from different countries allowed me to learn about their cultures, which completely changed how I viewed their countries. The entire experience opened my mind to new ideas and ways of thinking, and I gained valuable insights that I wouldn’t have otherwise had. It was a life-changing journey that taught me so much, both about the world and about myself.
